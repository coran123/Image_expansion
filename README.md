# Image expansion with GANs
In this project, we are presenting a deep learning approach for adversarially training
neural networks to naturally expend image boundaries. We use a three-phase training schedule to
stably train a DCGAN architecture on a subset of the Places365 dataset. Once trained, our model
is able to expend 128 Ã— 128 color images relatively realistically, thus allowing for recursive
expansion.
